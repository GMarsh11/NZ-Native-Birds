                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Kia ora, future bird experts! Meet the amazing Kererū, also known as the New Zealand wood pigeon. This beautiful **native** bird is **endemic** to Aotearoa, meaning it's found only here! The Kererū is very important for our forests.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Where Does the Kererū Live?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Kererū lives all over New Zealand! You'll find them in native forests, patches of bush, city parks, and even backyards with big trees. They love places with lots of fruit-growing trees and are often seen high in the branches.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">What Does the Kererū Eat?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Kererū love fruit! They mostly eat fruits from **native** trees like tawa, miro, and karaka. They swallow seeds whole, which helps spread them and grow new trees, keeping our forests healthy. If fruit is scarce, they might eat leaves and flowers.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Five Fun Facts About the Kererū!</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Big & Beautiful!</strong> The Kererū is large with stunning **plumage** – iridescent green and bronze on its back, and a bright white belly. They can swallow large fruits!</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Forest Gardeners:</strong> Kererū help new trees grow by spreading seeds, earning them the nickname "gardeners of the forest."</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Graceful Fliers:</strong> While they might look a bit wobbly landing due to their size, they are actually very graceful in flight.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Daytime Bird:</strong> The Kererū is **diurnal**, meaning it's active during the day. You'll see them flying or feeding then, unlike **nocturnal** birds like the kiwi.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Needs Our Help:</strong> Kererū face challenges from predators and habitat loss. While not as **endangered** as some birds, protecting them is vital!</li>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Kia ora! Get ready to meet one of New Zealand's most friendly and common **native** birds – the Fantail, or Pīwakawaka! These tiny birds are famous for their quick, zippy flights and beautiful fanned tails.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Where Does the Fantail Live?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Fantails are found all over New Zealand, from native forests to suburban gardens and parks. They prefer bushy areas where there are plenty of trees and shrubs to hunt for insects. You'll often see them flitting around close to people!</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">What Does the Fantail Eat?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Fantails are insect-eaters! They are incredibly agile flyers and catch insects in mid-air. They love to follow people or animals through the bush, catching the tiny bugs that get stirred up. Their quick movements help them grab their food!</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Five Fun Facts About the Fantail!</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Fan-tastic Tail:</strong> Their most famous feature is their wide, fanned tail, which they use like a rudder to help them make quick turns while flying and catching insects.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Friendly Fliers:</strong> Fantails are known for being very curious and will often fly quite close to people.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Many Eggs:</strong> Female fantails can lay up to five clutches of eggs in a single breeding season, which is a lot for a small bird!</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Busy as a Bee:</strong> These birds are rarely still! Their active, darting flight helps them catch their insect prey, and they are busy from dawn till dusk.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Different Plumage:</strong> While most fantails are grey-brown with a white belly, some are completely black. These darker ones are mostly found in the South Island.</li>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Kia ora! Let's learn about the Pukeko, a colourful and often seen **native** bird in New Zealand. With its bright blue **plumage** and bold red beak, it's hard to miss this bird!</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Where Does the Pukeko Live?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Pukeko love wetlands! You'll find them near swamps, marshes, lakes, rivers, and even damp grassy paddocks. They are common throughout New Zealand, especially in areas with long grass or reeds where they can hide and build their nests.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">What Does the Pukeko Eat?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Pukeko are mostly vegetarian, eating a lot of soft shoots and leaves from wetland plants, grasses, and seeds. But they are also opportunistic, meaning they will sometimes eat insects, eggs, or even small chicks if they get the chance!</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Five Fun Facts About the Pukeko!</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Long Toes:</strong> Pukeko have long, strong toes that help them walk easily over floating plants and soft mud in their wetland homes.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Super Swimmers:</strong> Even though they look like land birds, Pukeko are actually very good swimmers and can dive underwater if they need to escape danger.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Shared Nests:</strong> Pukeko often share nests and duties! Several females might lay eggs in the same nest, and many adults will help look after the chicks.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Nocturnal or Diurnal?:</strong> While mostly active during the day (**diurnal**), Pukeko can also be active at night (**nocturnal**) if they need to find food or if they feel safer from predators.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Not Endemic:</strong> While common in NZ, Pukeko are not **endemic**. They are found in many places around the world, including Australia and Southeast Asia.</li>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Kia ora! Let's discover the elegant White Heron, or Kōtuku, one of New Zealand's most beautiful and rare **native** birds. Its pure white **plumage** makes it a stunning sight to behold!</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Where Does the White Heron Live?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">The Kōtuku is quite special. Almost all of them breed in just one place in New Zealand: on the Waitangiroto River in Westland, South Island! After breeding, they spread out across the country, visiting many wetlands, estuaries, and shallow coastal areas before returning to their nesting site.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">What Does the White Heron Eat?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">White Herons are expert fishers. They use their long legs to wade slowly through shallow water, patiently waiting to spear fish, eels, frogs, and other aquatic creatures with their sharp beaks. They are very quiet and stealthy hunters!</p>

                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Rarest Bird:</strong> It's New Zealand's rarest breeding wetland bird. Its small population makes it a focus for conservation efforts, classifying it as **endangered** in some contexts.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Breeding Feathers:</strong> During breeding season, they grow special long, delicate feathers on their backs, which were once highly prized.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Global Traveller:</strong> While they have one main breeding spot in NZ, White Herons are actually part of a species (Great Egret) found in many parts of the world.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Patient Hunters:</strong> They stand perfectly still for a long time, watching the water. When a fish swims close, they strike with incredible speed!</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Where Does the Albatross Live?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Albatrosses spend most of their lives soaring over the vast oceans, travelling thousands of kilometres. While they range across the Southern Ocean, some species, like the Northern Royal Albatross, are **endemic** breeders to New Zealand, nesting only on the Otago Peninsula and Chatham Islands. They only come to land to breed!</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-700 mb-3">What Does the Albatross Eat?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Albatrosses are expert ocean hunters. They mainly eat squid, fish, and krill that they scoop from the surface of the water while flying or sitting on the waves. They have a special gland to help them get rid of extra salt from the seawater they drink!</p>

                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Biggest Wingspan:</strong> Albatrosses have the largest wingspan of any bird, some reaching over 3 metres! This helps them glide effortlessly on ocean winds.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Ocean Wanderers:</strong> They can spend years at sea without touching land, circling the globe multiple times on ocean currents.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Long Lifespan:</strong> Albatrosses can live for a very long time, often over 60 years! The oldest known wild bird, Wisdom the Laysan Albatross, is over 70 years old!</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Slow Breeders:</strong> They only lay one egg every two years, and it takes a long time for the chick to grow big enough to fly. This makes them vulnerable to threats, making many species **endangered**.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-emerald-600">Distinct Plumage:</strong> Adult Royal Albatrosses have striking white **plumage** with dark wingtips, making them look majestic as they fly.</li>
